CSS 
Styled keeping a column layout. Focused on enlarging important content and changed their display to block so as to improve visibility. Used !important to override previous website styles for media query. Used float and overlfow property along with absolute and relative positioning as needed. Made the page responsive to fit iPad and Smart Phones. Developed a media query which zooms in when hovered over. Used plenty of selectors and pseudoclasses.
